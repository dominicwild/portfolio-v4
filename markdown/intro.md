# Who am I?

Hello, I’m **Dominic**, a software engineer whose main ethos is *pragmatism* and *getting stuff done* — rather than
mindlessly following software principles, patterns, and “best practices.” I’m an agnostic engineer who works
across any tech stack and is known for getting up to speed quickly.

I’ve worked most deeply in **TypeScript** (web development) and **Java** (backend). I’ve also explored a range of other
technologies and frameworks including **Python**, **C#**, **C**, **PowerShell**, **Erlang**, and **PHP**. I enjoy taking
full ownership of my work — from writing the code to deploying it. I dislike bottlenecks and inefficiencies; if I can do
it myself, I’ll find a way — often improving the process as a result.

I don’t follow any one methodology religiously. I have experience with **TDD**, **pair programming**, **object-oriented
design**, **Scrum**, **Agile**, **CI/CD**, and more. Each has its place and trade-offs, and I’m always open to trying
new approaches.

Below is a collection of things I’ve worked on to give a clearer picture of me as a developer.
